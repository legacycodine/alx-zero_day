Do not use GitHub’s web UI, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else

You will need a GitHub account for all your projects at ALX. If you do not already have a github.com account, you can create an account for free here

Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token on Github
To have access to your repositories and authenticate yourself, you need to create a Personal Access Token on Github.

You can follow this tutorial to create a token.

Once it’s created, you should have a token that looks like this:



Step 2 - Update your profile on the Intranet
Update your Intranet profile by adding your Github username here

If it’s not done the Checker won’t be able to correct your work

Public repo
No README, .gitignore, or license


Step 4 - Open the sandbox
On the intranet, just under the task, click on the button  and run to start the machine.

Once the container is started, click on  to open a shell where you can start work from.

Step 5 - Clone your repository
On the webterm of the sandbox, do the following:

Clone your repository
root@896cf839cf9a:/# git clone https://{YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN}@github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/alx-zero_day.git                  
Cloning into 'alx-zero_day'...
